# Financial_Modeling_Projects
This repository showcases a collection of financial modeling and valuation projects built using real company financial statements. The models are fully integrated 3-statement structures incorporating income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow linkages to ensure analytical rigor and internal consistency.

Across projects, I perform DCF valuation, comparable company analysis (EV/EBITDA, P/E), scenario modeling, detailed supporting schedules (debt, depreciation, working capital), and WACC/terminal growth sensitivity analysis to stress-test assumptions and assess valuation ranges.

These projects reflect hands-on application of corporate finance, accounting, and valuation principles with a focus on clarity, robustness, and investment-oriented decision-making.
